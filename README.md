# VQA-Implication-Generator
To increase the accuracy and robustness of current state-of-the-art VQA systems, a new implication QA pair generator model has been implemented. The output of this can be used to train VQA systems.
A new human-annotated VQA-Implication dataset has been created, consisting of âˆ¼30k questions containing implications of 3 types - Logical Equivalence, Necessary Condition and Mutual Exclusion. Patterns and biases in the dataset has also been done using grammatical, logical and keyword analysis. The dataset and its analysis has been published here for further use in other projects.
